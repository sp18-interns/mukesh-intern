- ## âœ…Lexicographic order
Generalization of the way the alphabetical order of words is based on the alphabetical order of their component letters

In mathematics, the lexicographic or lexicographical order (also known as lexical order, or dictionary order) is a generalization of the alphabetical order of the dictionaries to sequences of ordered symbols or, more generally, of elements of a totally ordered set. There are several variants and generalizations of the lexicographical ordering. One variant applies to sequences of different lengths.
#### Example:-

## 01.
lexicographical order is alphabetical order. The other type is numerical ordering. Consider the following values,

1, 10, 2
Those values are in lexicographical order. 10 comes after 2 in numerical order, but 10 comes before 2 in "alphabetical" order.

## 02.
- (1.Father,2.Mother,3.Sister)
- (1.Father,2.Mother,3.ship,4.Sister)
- (1.Father,2.Mother,3.share,4.Ship,5.Sister)
