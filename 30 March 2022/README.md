 # Questions of hackerrank

 ## Q.1
Task
[The provided code stub reads and integer, n, from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i < n, print i^2
Example
n = 3
The list of non-negative integers that are less than  is n=3 is [0,1,2] . Print the square of each number on a separate line.

Input Format

The first and only line contains the integer,n .

Constraints
1=< n =< 20

Output Format

Print n  lines, one corresponding to each i.

## Q.2

The included code stub will read an integer, n, from STDIN.

Without using any string methods, try to print the following:
123....n

Note that "..." represents the consecutive values in between.

Example
n = 5
Print the string 12345.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer n .

Constraints
1 =< n =< 150

Output Format

Print the list of integers from 1 through n as a string, without spaces.

## Q.3

Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers x,y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n . Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n. Here, 0 =< i =< x; 0 =< j =< y; 0 =< k =< z. Please u k <e list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.

Example
x=1
y=1
z=2
n=3




All permutations of[i,j,k]  are:
.

Print an array of the elements that do not sum to n = 3 .


Input Format

Four integers x,y,z  and n , each on a separate line.

Constraints

Print the list in lexicographic increasing order.

Sample Output 0

[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
Explanation 0

Each variable x,y and z  will have values 0 or 1 of  or . All permutations of lists in the form .
Remove all arrays that sum to  n = 2 to leave only the valid permutations.
