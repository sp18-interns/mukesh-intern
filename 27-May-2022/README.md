### Topic
- Attend Demo on SQL session
- Learn Python 3 from Scartch
- ### Call by value and call by Refrence-Call By Value: In this parameter passing method, values of actual parameters are copied to functionâ€™s formal parameters and the two types of parameters are stored in different memory locations. So any changes made inside functions are not reflected in actual parameters of the caller.

Call by Reference: Both the actual and formal parameters refer to the same locations, so any changes made inside the function are actually reflected in actual parameters of the caller.
