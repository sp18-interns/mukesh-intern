#import sys in python is loading the module named sys into the current namespace so that you can access the functions and anything else defined within the module using the module name. On of the most common items is the list of arguments created when the program was called. This is sys.argv 5.1K views View upvotes Answer requested by Jack Hill
#How Hangman game Works
# The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words. The random module will provide this ability, so line 1 in program imports it.

# The Game: Here, a random word (a fruit name) is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game.

# When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.

# For convenience, we have given length of word + 2 chances. For example, word to be guessed is mango, then user gets 5 + 2 = 7 chances, as mango is a five letter word.

#read the words from an outside file and return one of those words, randomly chosen

        #By using the " self " keyword we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. "__init__" is a reseved method in python classes. It is known as a constructor in object oriented concepts. This method called when an object is created from the class and it allow the class to initialize the attributes of a class.
