### let's write the reverse condition

### Different rules for password
    
print ("Either have a super long password, 12+ characters, great password")
print ("If you have a password 8-11 character but with a # symbol, that is ok password")

print()
print()
if len_pwd >= 12:

elif len_pwd >= 8 and pwd.find('#') != -1:
    print ("You have an acceptable password")
else:
    print ("You have a weak password")
