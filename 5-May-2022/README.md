- ✅ Make a Game Thoughts
  - Evaluating Your Game - 
  Why would I have you try to do it yourself and then show you how to do it right? From now on
in the book, I’m going to try to make you self- suffi cient. I’ve been holding your hand mostly this
whole time, and I can’t do that for much longer. I’m now instead going to give you things to do,
have you do them on your own, and then give you ways to improve what you did.

  - Function style  -
  Keep your functions small and simple. For some reason, when people start learning
about classes, they forget this.
  - Class Style -
  Your class should use “camel case” like SuperGoldFactory rather than
super_gold_factory.
 • Try not to do too much in your __init__ functions. It makes them harder to use.
 • Your other functions should use “underscore format” so write my_awesome_hair and
not myawesomehair or MyAwesomeHair.

  - Code style -
  Give your code vertical space so people can read it. You will fi nd some very bad programmers who are able to write reasonable code but who do not add any spaces. This is bad
style in any language because the human eye and brain use space and vertical alignment
to scan and separate visual elements. Not having space is the same as giving your code
an awesome camoufl age paint job.
  - Good Comments -
  When you write comments, describe why you are doing what you are doing. The code
already says how, but why you did things the way you did is more important
  - Evaluate Your Game - 
  The purpose of this exercise is to train your attention to detail on classes. Once you are done with
this bit of code, fi nd someone else’s code and do the same thing. Go through a printed copy of
some part of it and point out all the mistakes and style errors you fi nd. Then fi x it and see if your
fi xes can be done without breaking that program.
