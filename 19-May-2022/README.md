 ### Stored Procedures for SQL server
- A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that 
is passed.

- ## Exception Handling-
 Some errors are generated by the application at runtime. These errors can be generated because of various reasons and the application is not able to handle these errors, causing the program to break and throw an exception.
